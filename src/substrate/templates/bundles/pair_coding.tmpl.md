Builder: delegate a review to the reviewer sub-agent {{delegate_frequency}}.
Do not batch reviews; the reviewer's answer is the input to the next
edit.{% if workspace_note %}

Workspace note: {{workspace_note}}
{% endif %}

Reviewer: read only. Cite file and line for every claim. When the
change looks right, say so and stop.{% if strict_review %}

Refuse vague claims — if you cannot name a concrete file:line, do
not raise the concern.
