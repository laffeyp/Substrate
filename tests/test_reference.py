"""Reference topologies R-1/R-2/R-3 — CI MODE (product §8).

These run the three reference topologies with DETERMINISTIC stand-in Producers (no network,
reproducible) and assert the wiring each topology exists to exercise. CI mode proves the
WIRING and gates every commit; it deliberately does NOT stand in for the walkthrough (the
spec is explicit that CI mode alone "sanitizes away the thing each topology exists to
demonstrate" — the real adjudication/overlap is the walkthrough, run separately against
local LLMs and documented in docs/walkthroughs/). Here we assert structure: the right events
appear on the record in the right relationships."""
