"""Observation contract for delegate (sprint 141, application-parity W2.1).

CI, deterministic, no network: a parent tool_loop scripted to call `delegate` once; the child is the
built-in calculator agent ((2+3)*4 = 20), pure and reproducible. Asserts the child runs as its OWN record,
the answer folds back into the parent's ToolResult, the parent's result cites the child root
(run-granularity provenance), and the depth/fan-out caps refuse with typed failures.

The review (2026-07-31) caught that the deterministic child hides the one thing delegate exists to do —
carry the task to a real model. `test_default_child_runs_the_real_model_on_the_task` (F-2/F-12) closes
that with a spy Responder; `test_read_only_suite_propagates` (F-5) and
`test_timed_out_child_is_cancelled_and_its_record_sealed` (F-8, the timed-out child is now cancelled +
sealed, not abandoned) close the other two delegate defects.
